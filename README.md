# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a Java program that implements a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game prompts two players to enter their moves (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and then determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

## 🔧 Program Structure

The program consists of a single class, `RockPaperScissors`, which contains the main method and all other methods required to run the game. The `StartGame` method implements the rules of the game, while the `playerMove` method prompts the players for their moves and loops the game until the players choose to stop.
